Line Follower Robot is a very basic project which almost every tech lover student has been done in their student life.Still I will mention this 
in my project list because I have done the whole project without doing any workshop and without anyone's help.when others waste their money 
doing the workshop held by Robotics of India.I also add some extra features so  that the robot can get more perfection to follow any line.
