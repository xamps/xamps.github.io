This project has been done by me at Tata Motors Limited.Whenever any vehicle will passes through any conveyor line we will get status of that 
vehicle from any remote control room.This make the whole system more efficient to track the status as well as record of every vehicle.
Here RFID reader and tag is used as the vehicle tracker,when RFID tag transmit the information about the vehicle passing through the 
conveyor line to PLC port through RFID reader.After getting the data at the com port from PLC,the data has been processed according to our wish.
