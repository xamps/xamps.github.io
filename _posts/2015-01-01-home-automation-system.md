This is our final year project.Now a day  home automation system is a honor  of the automated electronics industry. In  this regard
we want to make a circuit which will meet the requirement of control  the electronics home appliances,through a remotely controlled 
device which portable inside the room as well  as outside of the home .This device is also able to control the high  power  rating  
appliances remotely. And it will be a inexpensive system. And we also attach a security system in that device so that no one can control
those home appliances without any security privilege.
