			 Hello,I am Anny Bens over curious about my likes.I like to freak out myself until any problems solved.I don't like to bound myself to read anything as per
             hackneyed academic syllabus.Currently I am doing a project on Home Automation System,whenever it will be completed anyone will be able to control
             their home appliances from any remote side.As the total system connected with the internet, so anyone can switch on or off their home devices
             through a proper administrative privilege from any corner of the world.It can be a remedy of the wastage of power,as well as everyone will be able 
             to control their home appliances from any place at any time.I am looking forward for that day when it will be applicable successfully.
            </p>
